File Transfer/Processing Programs from Fall 2017.

The two projects transfer and process files between a server and client with socket programming in C.

Project 1 uses UDP.

Project 2 uses TCP.

Program performance was analyzed with Wireshark when the router was set to drop a certain ratio of packets.
